        <h1> All About Me </h1>
            <hr/>
        <h2> About My Family </h2>
            <p> <b>In</b> my family, I have a mom, dad, one brother, and two sisters. I am the oldestin my family and was adopted. My sister, Emily, was adopted also but we are not related by blood. Molly and Emily are in 6th grade and my brother is a Freshman at Salesianum <b> School.</b> <b> We </b> don’t have any pets but we used to have a cat and a fish. I <b> don't </b> play sports anymore but my siblings all do. Emily plays basketball, golf, track, and volleyball. Molly plays volleyball and track. Andrew plays basketball and track. <!-- This paragraph describes the people in my family --> </p>
        <h2> Some Facts About Me</h2>
            <p> My mom is a nerd, which made my siblings and I grow up watching marvel, dc, and doctor who kind of stuff. So, we go to all the new Marvel movies and we usually <b> watch </b> them all together in theaters. I have the hardest time deciding my favorite movie because I love them for different reasons and I have the same dilemma with picking music. Sometimes I can’t even decide what genre I like the most for music or movies but I hate horror <b>movies </b> and I’m not really into rap. However, my favorite book is <i> On the Fence</i> by Kasie West.</p> <!-- This paragraph describes some of the things  I like and I dislike -->
        
            <p> I have two best friends and some really really close friends. My best friends are from St.Thomas, which is the school <u> I</u> went to 7th and 8th grade but my other close friends are from Holy Family. Some of my friends are from my first, Holy Savior, and moved with me to Holy Family. However, my best friends are from my last school because we just connected more. We <u> like </u> going to the <u> movies </u> and our birthdays are close together. </p> <!-- This paragraph describes my friends and a little history on the schools I went to -->
